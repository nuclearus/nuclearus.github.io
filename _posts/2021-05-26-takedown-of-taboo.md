Warning: This post contains swears and is highly sharp. You'll see what I mean. This is a combination of logic and sharp emotion that derides you with even more logic. If you aren't ready to see how I talk when I get genuinely worked up over something, don't go past 'Elbows on Table'. Good luck. This is raw me.

## Taboos and Sensitive Topics
Note:
A common trend for all of these (which is actually just talking about any topics in general), is only talk to them with people you **trust**. That goes for **any** topic. And obviously, if it's genuinely a sensitive topic, 


Some things in the world that are considered 'taboo' or inappropriate to talk about make no sense. For example,
the amount of money you have, your weight (women), your age (women), putting elbows on a table, etc. Not only are some of these (especially the women one) blatantly sexist, they also make NO FUCKING SENSE.

Obviously, if the person you're talking to has some sensitive topic (say, with weight, they've been through some fucked up harrassment, bullying, etc. that has caused them serious trauma), then of course you'd not talk about that. Or at least understand it's a sensitive topic and you should tread carefully. But that's not topic specific, you spazza (I mean this endearingly)! You talk about war with people, but would you talk about it in the same detail when the person has major PTSD? No! It completely depends on the person's unique circumstances.

In reality, topics (such as the women age one) are only deemed sensitive (and elicit a genuine reaction out of people) because SOCIETY HAS DEEMED IT SENSITIVE, AND THE PERSON IN THAT SOCIETY HAS TAKEN UP THE CULTURE'S VALUES TO FIT IN. If you think about it from a logical basis, it makes exactly 0 sense.

Are you serious? Let's talk about each of these individually.

<h3> Money </h3>
Often, the amount of money earnt is considered taboo. Why? Seriously. Give me some reasons. Would the people around you be jealous? *Why?* That's their problem, lol. And if they your friends, maybe rethink the definition of friend. Obviously, don't flaunt around "Oh yeah I make $150K per year" or some shit. That's dumb. But if someone asks you, why wouldn't you respond honestly?

Oh, they might talk behind your back? About what? You make more money, ok. Now what? Money != Happiness (although the first $60k definitely improves life satisfaction, but then the ratio of money:happiness decreases as you earn more).
If they start comparing their life to yours, their problem (once again). You do realise that the way you live (the actions you do) is much more telling than some wallop of cash you earn.
From <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-do-not-disclose-their-salary-to-others#:~:text=It%20is%20considered%20rude%20for,start%20comparing%20so%20many%20things."> this </a> article, talking about it is considered 'rude'. Literally why? Are you a fucking deg? THINK, MAN, THINK!

If you feel like you're gonna be negatively judged by the people, don't tell them... It's not that hard? It's just like anything else? A common trend for all of these (which is actually just talking about any topics in general), is only talk to them with people you **trust**.

<h4> Positives of talking about it </h4>

If the environment was more open to your salary, etc, then maybe wages would be fairer? Maybe the obscene act that wages haven't followed inflation for god knows how long would be fixed. You could argue for better job opportunities (<a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/a28515/why-cant-we-talk-about-how-much-we-make/"> implying that not-talking about your salary may be a tactic from your company so you don't get better job offers, or aren't aware of them </a>).

<h3> Onto Women! </h3>

Yes, the title is a bit clickbaity, and I'm sure there's some men specific examples too (even these ones count, but for some reason this is more 'sensitive' to talk about for women). 

#### Weight
If you don't know that every model is photoshopped to the roof, and a decent amount of them suffer from anxiety for not having the perfect body, well, now you do. Shit's impossible. You can get a decent body by putting in the work, but yeah. Don't stress. 

Anyways, back to shitting on this. What the fuck is wrong with you? How is the number and constituating particles within your body at all offensive to you when you have no reason to be offended? Bro, I just want to know how much mass you have. Is that too much? I'm just asking man; maybe you can punch harder than expected or push with more force than I estimated, idk. I'm just trying to improve my estimation systems! In case you aren't aware, most people tend to not have a 'perfect weight'. There's a decent range of what is considered healthy weight based on factors such as height, nutrition, genetics, etc. (I don't know too much in this domain).  Just be healthy 4head.

#### Age 
I'm sorry, did I scare you by asking you how contracted the length of your telomeres are? Spoiler alert: The march of time never stops, you'll never age younger. You can relatively slow your aging by moving faster than another observer but that won't stop it, but instead dilate the time. You're growing older. Accept it. Maybe you'll be more confident with your body and mind then. I tried to read a medium article (but it's behind a paywall :) ), so instead had to ELI5 reddit it. Apparently it's a remnant tradition with something to do with appearance and how well you can marry/child bear? Sorry, fucker, but people don't really care about your age. Most people are more in tune with, idk... your face and not numbers because they were given mathophobia from school???

 Also, if it's about appearance... What? The way you look is an indication of your appearance, not your age. You ok bud? Your face is an indication of your appearance. Am I missing something? 

If the society you live in has taught you that age matters, then, why are you listening to that aspect of it? It's clearly suboptimal.
### Rude Manners

#### Elbows on Table

Seriously? Ok, say you think this. May I ask why? What is the logical derivation from some base set of [fundamental morals](/blog/1337/01/12/useful-concepts) you've assumed to reach the conclusion "Placing elbows on the table whilst eating is bad manners." This is just one you were told and accepted by someone with more authority than you without any push-back. Simple case; just throw it out of your system.


### Homosexuality

I wasn't gonna even put this in because it's so dumb to be against it if you created your own base set of [fundamental morals](/blog/1337/01/12/useful-concepts) and built up from there. Oh no!!!! The majority of the world population still wants to fuck the other gender so there's no anti-population problems (i.e still enough babies are being made so humanity's not gonna fucking die out). But these like 10% of the population want to fuck each other in the ass or do the scissors thing, oh no! I'm not there to watch it, but I don't like it, oh no! Sucks. There's way worse shit going on in this messed up planet that is really not fun to think about, but people who tend to feel attracted towards something that's not conventional is too much? At worst, homosexuality is some variation within the brain structure where a switch was flipped. That's the whole point of evolution. Given an enclosed environment, shoving a bunch of entities in there that mutate will eventually result in an optimal specimen for that specific environment. Being against gays is kinda like being against evolution; evo's just doing its shit man; how do you think you were made? Nature gives precisely 0 shits, it just does what it does.
 That's all. Like, oh well, they wanna fuck their own gender. Who cares. Big deal. I only care about their potential and productivity and personality as a human being with ideas in their heads. People really stuck up over the smallest of things. "Oh that guy likes dick in his ass." Ok. Cool? I'd still fuckin resurrect Alan Turing any day of the week. I don't think I can ever forget that what was essentially homophobia drove **Alan Fucking Turing** to suicide.

 Alan. Fucking. Turing. TURING.

Nobody's asking for you to strip naked, strap twenty rainbow flags onto yourself and run down the street every day of the year, or yell "I LOVE GAY PEOPLE" at random intervals throughout the day (if they are, realise that they are being the dick here). Just go about your day, that's it. Nobody's asking you to do anything. Just don't walk up to someone and say 'yeah fuck you for being this thing you can't change.' That's pretty cringe, and is in fact a dick move. Not just about homos, for anything. 

Side note: Don't gay people kinda help us with overpopulation problems? Most homo couples probably won't have kids. Like... Even though overpopulation won't really happen (it'll cap ~11 billion), isn't this just good? Also, this gives heterosexuals less competition to have to deal with for any N potential mating partner.
<!-- 

{FUNDAMENTAL  MORALS -> religions; assume high level hodge podge morals. Conflicting ideas (God loves everyone unconditionally, but conditionally. Huh?) Not that there's anything wrong with religion; it's quite a good defense against nihilism and was a good enough approximation of a book of morals to get societies functioning for a while. Interesting how so many different cultures produced religions; maybe it's like the eye in evolution? The advantages of it were so powerful that the actor converged to it multiple times even when they weren't aware of others (i.e didn't have the gene originally?) } -->
## Racism and MORE
**Editor's Note: I go ham here**

I just mentioned it above, so I might as well here. Honestly didn't even think about putting shit like this in, like, seriously? Being racist is cringe. It's pretty obvious that most of the differences in literally any quality of life / 'success' metric is based originally off of: environment born/raised in, economic status of immediate family (or the people you interact with), also the people you interact with (environment again). The genetic difference is fucking laughably miniscule, all it is is:

You:

- spawned in an OP starter area where you can level up really quickly and meet OP people (it's actually a major trading hub)
- just didn't have to re-invent the wheel about 10000 times
- have access to fast travel scrolls
- have access to the wiki of the game when other people don't
- can talk to level 100 people and get boosted easily
- have access to a global friends list 
- have more savepoints so if you mess up, you don't get booted into the fucking nether straight up.

#### A fun experiment
If you really think that the genetic difference is the only cause of any difference, well, let's have an experiment, shall we? Take a few thousand babies born in an undeveloped, no-electricity no-education part of Africa (because Africa isn't actually all bad) and swap them with a few thousand babies in western high middle-class income (and even more) families. Actually, **don't swap the babies once they're born because that actually lets the mother's nutrition/malnutrition level play a factor into the baby** (see effects of smoking + alcohol on pregnant women & their babies).

So, instead, let's **Swap the eggs**. The fertile eggs. Just yoink the few thousand, and swap em. See what happens?

Even factoring in the weirdness of adopted family situations, I woooonnder what could possibly happen? I wonder if... Perhaps... The humans in the western well-off families will have a higher success rate, higher education, higher nutrition, better physicality, etc. Wow! I wonder if perhaps once you round all their stats up, it'll look just like any other statistical distribution of academic/sports grade for the same large N sample size.

And what about the kids born in the undeveloped parts of Africa? I wonder if they'll have to work only menial labour jobs for hours upon hours a day in order to survive, which reduces their education, sleep, etc. I wonder if the lack of medicine would mean they have a higher death rate and constant malnutrition won't help too.


### The "Catch"




#### Side note on Diarrhea
Oh yeah, you know that diarrhea used to be one of the leading causes of death before modern medicine and better nutrition? Seriously. [Diarrhea today has killed more than all 'intentional injuries'.](https://ourworldindata.org/childhood-diarrheal-diseases) It's actually a fucking nasty one, but to any developed nation it's just like 'oh haha fast poopies brrr'. It's the third leading cause of child mortality in the world. Main reason is because of the malnutrition and dehydration you experience after it. 

### Back to Racism; Fun Little Imagery
Racism is a subset of discrimination. So is discrimination based on economic status, social status and whatnot. Being racist against white people is still racist. Whaaat??? Woah! No shit, fucker. 

But how can you be racist against white people? Overcatering towards group A and leaving group X in the dust is still discrimination, and actually harbours hatred in X towards A so in the long term it could actually backfire. So. Wtf??

Here's some quick imagery: Every poor white person constantly on the verge of homelessness struggling paycheck to paycheck with bank loans tied around their necks harder than any noose as they barely manage to bring their starving kids (who will now perform academically worse and thus have less opportunities for higher paying jobs) to school. This also applies to non-white people. In case you haven't FUCKING NOTICED YET, the race BARELY MAKES A DIFFERENCE. It's the economic power they hold.


### Switching to Poverty
So, where does the poverty come from? A very good question.
I don't actually have too many stats on this, but here's some [quick google search results](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/top-9-causes-global-poverty). Obviously there's some lazy shits, but that's a subset of the demographic I just mentioned. Most of the time, it's legit just a bad spawn. And spawning in poverty drastically reduces your chance of getting any meaningful money increases even if you work as hard as others. I'd hypothesis that climbing out of poverty is significantly harder than a millionaire making another million. 

You wanna know some issues about poverty? Ok. Inflation increases the price of items yet wages don't match the increase, which leads to a slow siphoning of consumer purchasing power over time. 


Say that you've somehow managed to become 5head by reading at your local library, somehow finding the time to do this as you juggle multiple poor paying jobs that takes ungodly hours from your life, sleep deprivation, feeding your kids whenever you can whilst you suffer from greater malnutrition. Ok. 

Who's gonna hire your broke ass? You think you have enough money to spend on fancy clothes when your mortgage is rear naked choking you out? You're getting railed harder than a railway on a major traintrack.

Tl;dr: Let's assume everyone has roughly equal amounts of energy to spend per day. Those in poverty *must* spend much more energy to meet basic necessities and keep their life afloat, giving them little opportunity to improve themselves and by extension their situation. It takes all the energy just to keep the situation still.

This is opposed to a non-impoverished person, who has much more energy to do whatever they want -- the safety net is much larger. They can *afford* to do much less, knowing that the safety net is there and their situation won't immediately de-escalate into some fuckfest. And if they want to do more, nice!

### Math

Math isn't that bad, the way school taught you was. You can interpret maths in a lot of ways. One of the most practical ones: 

See it as tools. As a bunch of tools that can help you solve problems. What school didn't do but **really should** is give you some tangible, practical problem that you have no idea how to solve first. Then, reverse engineer from the solution to where you are now. You're gonna learn these fun little 'tools' or concepts called MATHS that make the problem a whole lot easier to break down.

Like, imagine tree fractal UIs on javascript (the p5js library). Wouldn't that be a cool way to learn about maths? Recursiveness, fractions, etc. And that's how you'd use it.
![Fractal Tree](/assets/p5js/fractaltree.png)
Instead of it being some arbitrary concept that has no use, it's now a tool you used to solve a problem to get this really cool result!

As a 'maths person', I didn't like art in primary school. In hindsight, I didn't like the way art was taught, and how we had to follow all these rules and weird colouring mechanics. Eventually, I realised the truth (other than math = art, because it is); A high-end skill ceiling for art is the ability to represent any image that you can conjure up in your imagination. **Any image**. **Can be**. **Created**. If you can visualise it, you can theoretically draw it.


## To do: Polyamogous thingy
<!-- ### Abortion

Let's get something straight. People die. Let's assume abortion is murder.

This one is actually heavily dependent on the situation, but we'll follow the logic here:
Going with the lower-class situation, potential young single mother with little financial backing.

(If you want my truly personal no-pure logic held idea: I mean. Fuck em. People die all the time. If there's a legitimate reason for killing it (assuming it's murder and has a consciousness or something), go on. You could also stop child-deaths and human deaths by increasing road and traffic safety regulations, open sourcing technology to increase safety but that's not gonna happen is it? Not when there's money to be made. [Or maybe save the 4.6 million deaths per year from air pollution?](https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/air_pollution.htm#:~:text=The%20World%20Health%20Organization%20estimates,directly%20attributable%20to%20air%20pollution.) No carbon tax tho, huh? Let's argue about abortion instead. Fucking what? Priorities. Get them.)
Pro-life (in the conventional sense) is actually anti-life. Even if you murder the child now, the long run is worse. Because you'll end up hurting not only the child (by spawning him into a life of poverty), but also yourself (because you just signed a contract that forced you into poverty and can't leave it without doing some things that *hurt*.)

In the words of someone: "I'd be pissed if I had a living parasite that I knew would ruin my life and its own life but I couldn't feetus yeetus it because some old guy said no. Bitch, you have the baby!"
The primary reason pro-life = anti-life in this case is simple: Money.

#### The example situation
Why? Say the baby child is born. The independent mother, who is young and doesn't have a strong stable source of income, must defend the child (we'll assume in this case that foster care / adoption isn't a thing. The mother is raising the shitter to child hood). [Average child raising cost is $160K-550K](https://www.finder.com.au/life-insurance-and-the-cost-of-raising-children#:~:text=It%20found%20that%20the%20cost,to%20%24548%2C500%20over%2018%20years.). Without a strong income, the family is in poverty, yes? *Poverty*. Remember that word? That painful fucking scythe that strangles you? Yeah, that one. Let's go.

Assuming 1 mother 1 child, the mother must first work potentially multiple jobs to be able to get enough money for basic necessities such as shelter (mortgage ass), electricity, food, etc. Given the fact that the mother is young leads to the conclusion that it is statistcally probable that most of these situations will have lower paying jobs, so the probability of only having a single high paying job is low. Thus, we have problem 1:

Either the mother can leave the emotional and physical development of the child in shambles (which, by the way, motherly affection increases neural growth in children) whilst she has to work hours on end to pay for expenses, or the mother tends to the development of the child whilst forgoing the proper financial necessitities, which will lead to at best, malnutrition issues (guess what motherfucker? Malnutrition is really not good for a brain that growing.)

Alright, so the kid is fucked one way or another. Now school starts; the kid's in poverty so instantly he's most likely going to some public school (nothing wrong with that). But. His fees for the books, the clothes, the shoes and socks? Sure, you can cover it initially. Can you cover the fees and excursions too? Oh, you can? Nice! You holding up well with that 1 meal a day every sometimes, bud? You think your kid doesn't worry about you? Fucking retard. Kids are kids, but they're not dumb. Say you somehow weren't abusive (or had an abusive partner -- by the way, if this is the case oh boy does the cycle repeat) and you managed to hold it together for the kid as he grows up. They'll grow worried over you to the point where they want to spend more time with you as opposed to getting an education which can at least give them a glimmer of hope at escaping the god forsaken cycle you're in.

But he's already fallen down that spiral. In an attempt to help you, he's forsaken his future life as someone that can escape it. You can try to force him away (if you're strong enough to not get that emotional support), so he'll get some attachment issues from being rejected by his own and only authority figure as a child whilst you get completely brain fucked by not being able to support your kid when he needs it the most. By the way, saying things like "I'm doing this for you" doesn't really work. Hitting a child, even if they are given a reason why, does not diminish the feelings of insecurity the child felt when hit.

This is assuming an ideal scenario where you aren't fucking the kid up remember?

Oh, by the way, since this is poverty, guess what's happening in schoool!!?!?!???! Bullying time pooog!!! He's not gonna make that many friends because he's socially and emotionally traumitised oooooh spooooooky. And if they get fucked by an abusive parent, oh boy. It's already over.

Because you know what's gonna happen to a kid that gets traumitised? They're gonna become you! The parent. They're now either completely fucked and doing criminal activities, wasting their life away, or are stuck in poverty looking for that glimmer of hope (so they get pushed to the poverty example).

To sum up: They lived in poverty for 7-8 years, became aware

Because killing it is worse than letting it live *this type of life*. Right?
//
So that's that example. What about foster caring the fucker?


To be honest, I don't know how to explain this topic.

At the end of the day, it just feels like, it's their choice? If I was a woman, I'm yeeting the fucker out. No poverty for us. We'll make that one again later, and he'll live a worthwhile life.

If you were a woman (assuming you're pro-life), you can have the baby! It's that simple. This shit's way too complicated; combining the perspectives are really shit. So, just make it legal. If they want to, they can.


**My professional conclusion: Don't be a dick. Make it legal, if they want to abort, they abort. If not, they not.**


Consider the baby's perspective: Do they want to die or live? 
The mother's perspective
The boyfriend's perspective ??
The environment's perspective????


Pro-choice: If you wanna abort, you can, if you don't want to, don't.

Pro life  : If you wanna abort, you can't, if you don't want to, you can't.

This is the difference between the 2.


I don't think this is fundamental moral level, but the path to reach it from moral basis is odd. Tl;dr: Don't be a dick! 


////
THE DATA:
https://www.worldometers.info/abortions/

So, if the number of abortions is insane, the to/die factor is this:
What's the % of abortions/pregnancies that occur in impoverished families? Like..
If it's 10%. Imagine. Imagine the number of poverty cycles you just added to the world because the fucker's didn't go byebye so now they'll have to suffer a shitty life before going byebye. Developing a country gets harder when you have more mouths to feed.
/////

Another way:

Other people want you to do it, you don't want to do it, you get no benefit from doing it.

What do other people get from doing it (some couple's gonna get a foster babi) and what do you get from doing it (even tho you didn't want to do it)? (A fockin baby lad, 9 months of pregnancy -> entails restrictions of lifestyle, vomit, pain, contraction, that thing called childbirth,) The baby: restrictions of lifestyles, enlarged canal or somethin -->

I figured out a way to determine whether 
1. Any moral problem has an overall solution (has a steady state as opposed to eternally fucked)
2. How to reach an average consensus
